# Beer_Generation
This repository is for a project attempting to use machine learning to generate craft beer recipes, in particular hop schedules

## Authors
Mitch Schiller and Kevin McPherson

## Data Acquisition
Beer data was compiled from two webscrapes done on a beer recipe database called Brewer's Friend. The first contained macro information such as category, ABV, IBU, etc.
The second joined this data with the recipe specifics: grains, hops, yeast, water additions and adjuncts.

## Data Cleaning
Cleaning and preprocessing is in progress:
Using domain knowledge, we narrowed the dataset down to provide a higher quality of data for future learning, ridding the dataset of outliers, input errors, and extraneous information.
